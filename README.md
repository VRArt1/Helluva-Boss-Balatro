![Preview 1 Main Menu (1 8 0)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/764fd0cf-d1eb-48c6-be5d-28a3f315d96b)

This mod aims to be an overhaul of Balatro adding in content as if it was an official Vivziepop collab and yes that means as much swearing, edgy humor, and dark colors as I could squeeze in.

## Mod Content

* Custom Deck <sub>(Low and High Contrast versions)</sub>
* Custom Suit Names <sub>(Toggleable)</sub>
* 5 Card Backs <sub>(Malverk)</sub>

* 5 Sleeves
* 16 Quips <sub>(Toggleable)</sub>
* 8 **Swears**
